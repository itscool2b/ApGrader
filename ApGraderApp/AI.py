- **Causation**: The prompt asks the student to explain causes and/or effects of historical events or developments.
- **Continuity and Change Over Time (CCOT)**: The prompt asks the student to analyze what changed and what remained the same over a particular time frame.

1. Read the provided LEQ prompt carefully.
2. Identify whether the prompt is a **Comparison**, **Causation**, or **CCOT** prompt.
3. **Respond with only one of the three exact words**: "Comparison", "Causation", or "CCOT". **Do not include any additional text, explanations, or characters. Should be one word**

   - The response must demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt.
   - To earn this point, the essay must incorporate sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence. This can include:
     - **Exploring nuance** by analyzing multiple themes or perspectives.
     - **Explaining both sides of a concept**, such as similarity and difference, continuity and change, or multiple causes or effects.
